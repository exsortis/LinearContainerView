LinearContainerView
===================

Purpose
-------

This is a layout container that manages its subviews by laying them out horizontally or vertically.

Usage
-----

Add this view to your view hierarchy, then add subviews (generally buttons, but it works for all views) that you want
laid out. Set the `layoutMode` according to whether you want a horizontal layout or a vertical one. Any view that is 
not hidden or alpha 0 will be lined up nicely within the container.
